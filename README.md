# ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork and Paper
A CNN implementation in tensorflow along with a NIPS style paper on the analysis of this model on the MNIST and the CIFAR10 datasets and approaches to improve accuracy. The code for the analysis of the model  for the MNIST Dataset is self written while the code for the CIFAR10 Dataset was taken from the TensorFlow's website.
